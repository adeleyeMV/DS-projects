## The Data Modelling Process:
1. Gather requirements
2. Conceptual Data Modelling
3. Logical Data Modelling

## Important Feature of RDBMS:
**Atomicity** - Whole transaction or nothing is processed  
**Consistency** - Only transactions abiding by constraints & rules is written into database  
**Isolation** - Transactions proceed independently and securely  
**Durability** - Once transactions are committed, they remain committed  

## When to use Relational Database?
### Advantages of Using a Relational Database
* Flexibility for writing in SQL queries: With SQL being the most common database query language.
* Modeling the data not modeling queries
* Ability to do JOINS
* Ability to do aggregations and analytics
* Secondary Indexes available : You have the advantage of being able to add another index to help with quick searching.
* Smaller data volumes: If you have a smaller data volume (and not big data) you can use a relational database for its simplicity.
* ACID Transactions: Allows you to meet a set of properties of database transactions intended to guarantee validity even in the event of errors, power failures, and thus maintain data integrity.
* Easier to change to business requirements
